# Chisel-Ztones

This jmod is a redesign of BBoldt's excellent Minetweaker script, [Chizzle-Z-tizzle](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/chizzle-z-tizzle).  The purpose of this script is to remove all the block crafting recipes from Ztones, and replace them with more comprehensive (and less expensive) recipes for the aurora block and ztone tile, and leave all the decoration to the Chisel mod.

This version includes the ability to craft a ztone tile from each of the ztone varieties, so you can redesign ztone tiles as you wish.
