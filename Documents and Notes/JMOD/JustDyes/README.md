# Just Dyes

Just Dyes is exactly what it says on the tin.  This mod includes five dyes that can be used as the modpack author desires.

The dyes this mod replaces are to restore balance to your games.  Some dyes are easy to get, others are hard to find, and in some cases, too rare to be useful.  These are dyes, they are meant for decoration!  Why do we need to search the world for a desert just for the ironic chance to collect green dye?  Why should we dig deep into the earth just to get the equally-ironic blue dye?  Or risk drowning, just to get ink?

And then there's the balance issues with the cocoa beans, cactus green, and bonemeal.

Just Dyes adds dyes to replace the above, so the modpack author can make the game as colorful as they want, without the balance issues.  This mod includes white, black, blue, green, and brown dyes that have a neutral origin (they can be crafted from flowers, or found in other processes), and are single-purpose, meaning that white dye doesn't cause plants to grow fast, brown die can't be used in cookies, and green dye won't become Buildcraft pipe sealant.

It is recommended to install [Pam's Weee! Flowers](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/pams-weee-flowers) with this mod, as it will provide the flowers that this mod crafts into the custom dyes.
