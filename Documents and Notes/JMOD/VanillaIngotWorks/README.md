# Vanilla Ingot Works

Early-game smelting consists of throwing an ore into a furnace and getting 1 ingot out of it.  In order to do ore doubling or alloying, you need to download some kind of major mod that either provides some kind of ore processor or a special furnace that provides a multiplier of output.  If you want ore doubling or alloying with a vanilla feel, there's not a lot of options available.

Vanilla Ingot Works changes this.

This mod includes two items that are craftable in the early game: The crucible, and the sand mold.  A crucible is formed using a block of clay and a block of sand, while the sand mold simply requires the block of sand.  Before you can use the crucible, you need to fire it in the furnace.

To use this system, you simply place your ore or ingots into the crucible (it can hold a maximum of 2 ores or 2 ingots), smelt the filled crucible, and then craft it with the mold to make your ingots.  That's it.

To get the most from this mod, it is recommended you also use the Common Ores mod, as this mod will allow you to smelt the alloys available from that mod.
