# Simple Wooden Bucket

Some modpacks are designed to discourage immediate mining, which means that the bucket, needed to make a farm patch or milk a cow, is not available to the player.  There are other mods that supply early-game buckets, but Tinker's Construct is a lot of mod for a single bucket, and [SBM]Wooden Bucket requires cactus green as a sealant, which, once again, makes a bucket hard to come by without (ironically) searching a desert.

This mod includes a wood-only bucket.  It is simple compared to the others; it can only hold water or milk, but it is more than sufficient to collect water and milk in the early-game until the player is ready to mine iron.
